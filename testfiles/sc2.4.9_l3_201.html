    <h1>Beverages</h1>
    <p>This page gives an overview on types of beverages (&copy; of text by wikipedia.org).</p>
    <p>Coffe: Coffee is a widely consumed stimulant beverage prepared from roasted seeds, commonly
      called beans, of the coffee plant.</p>
    <p>Tea: Tea is a beverage made by steeping processed leaves, buds, or twigs of the tea bush,
      Camellia sinensis, in hot water for a few minutes. The processing can include oxidation,
      heating, drying, and the addition of other herbs, flowers, spices, and fruits.</p>
    <p>Wine: Wine is an alcoholic beverage made from the fermentation of grape juice. The natural
      chemical balance of grapes is such that they can ferment without the addition of sugars,
      acids, enzymes or other nutrients.</p>
    <p>Liquour: A distilled beverage is a consumable liquid containing ethyl alcohol (ethanol)
      purified by distillation from a fermented substance such as fruit, vegetables, or grain. The
      word spirits generally refers to distilled beverages low in sugars and containing at least 35%
      alcohol by volume. Absinthe, baijiu, brandy, gin, rum, tequila, vodka, whisky, and traditional
      German schnapps are types of spirits.</p>
