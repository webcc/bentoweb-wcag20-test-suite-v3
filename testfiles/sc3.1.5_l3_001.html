  <h1><span lang="fr">René Girard</span>'s Fundamental Anthropology</h1>
  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>What Girard sets out to do is to try to find the missing link between two problems that
have occupied several scientific disciplines. On the one hand anthropologists and
ethnologists have tried to find the origin of religion and the variety in religions, but
because they failed to find this common origin&#8212;especially between 1860 and 1920 the
expectations were very high&#8212;they declared that this kind of research was pointless (E. E.
Evans-Pritchard and G. Dumézil, among others; <acronym class="bibref" lang="fr" title="Des choses cach&eacute;es depuis la fondation du monde">CC</acronym> 12).
On the other hand ethologists have tried to explain the process of hominization&#8212;<acronym title="that is to say">i.e.</acronym> the evolutionary development of
characteristics, especially mental ones, that are held to distinguish man from other animals&#8212;and
have recognized the problem of the origin of symbolicity. On the one
hand, human scientists have often used a typically human characteristic, such as the
incest taboo, an economic or a socio-political motive as a starting point for the evolution
from animal to man. Some anthropologists insisted that
<q>all human behavior originates in the use of symbols</q> (Haviland 37).
In <i class="booktitle" lang="de">Totem und Tabu</i> (1913), <span lang="de">Freud</span> based his theory
on the assumption that the Oedipus complex is innate and universal, which did not
convince the anthropologists. The major objection against these approaches is that it is
methodologically unsound to found all phenomena which are typically human, all
manifestations of culture, on a characteristic unique to humans. On the other hand,
ethologists, who used an animal characteristic as a starting point, could not find a
satisfactory explanation for the origin of such phenomena as language, religion and
morals. For example, the assumption that the incest taboo is natural in origin does not
convince anthropologists like Lévi-Strauss (Lévi-Strauss 100-01). <span lang="fr">René Girard</span>’s
account, however, starts from an animal instinct, imitation, and shows how it can lead to
the human social systems that have come to replace those of our ancestors.
</p>

<h2>2. Mimesis</h2>
<p>The point of departure in <span lang="fr">René Girard</span>’s theory of culture is mimesis or imitation,
terms with a long and rich tradition that started with Plato and Aristotle.
In Plato’s account, which influenced all subsequent thinking on imitation, mimesis only refers to
behaviour and forms of speech that are essentially forms of representation; and Aristotle
wrote, as is well-known, that man differs from the other animals in his greater aptitude
for imitation. Some psychologists and sociologists at the end of the nineteenth century
considered mimesis as the sole basis of social harmony and progress. Mimesis is a term
used to refer to imitation in the learning process, biology, the description of rituals,
drama, literature <abbr title="etcetera">etc</abbr>. However, according to <span lang="fr">Girard</span>, our understanding of human
behaviour and human culture in general has been hampered by the exclusion of the kind
of behaviour involved in appropriation in all Western thinking on imitation.
</p>
<p>Neurologists have repeatedly reminded us that the human brain is an enormous
imitating machine. In <i class="booktitle" lang="de">Das sogenannte Böse</i>, the ethologist <span lang="de">Konrad Lorenz</span> pointed out
that the importance of individual experience and learning in social animals increases with
the level of development; as the experience of the oldest individual in a group increases,
so the passing down of individually acquired information becomes more important in
comparison with innate or instinctive patterns of behaviour (51-52). <span lang="de">Lorenz</span> concludes
that natural selection in social animals works in the direction of a better development of
learning abilities, because not only each individual but also the group as a whole benefits
from this. In order to establish a science of man, <span lang="fr">Girard</span> argues, it is necessary to
compare human imitation with the mimetic behaviour of animals and to map the typically
human forms of mimetic behaviour. There is no reason to exclude from such research the
kind of behaviour involved in appropriation, since it is important in humans as well as in
other living beings and liable to be imitated.</p>
<p>The belief in mimesis as a cohesive force is the consequence of a narrow conception
of the term. There seems to be no reason to think that young animals and children, when
imitating, do consciously distinguish between behaviour they have to learn&#8212;<acronym title="for example">e.g.</acronym> hunting
animals learn the best methods of killing their prey by watching their parents do so&#8212;and
behaviour aiming at the appropriation of food or objects. The latter type of behaviour is
called ‘acquisitive mimesis’ (‘<span lang="fr">imitation acquistive</span>’, ‘<span lang="fr">mimésis d’appropriation</span>’) and can
be observed in primates and in children alike. If one ape sees another reach for an object,
it is immediately tempted to imitate the gesture. It also happens that the animal resists
the temptation, because, like adults, it has learned to fear the rivalry that could ensue
from several hands reaching for the same object. Such conflicts that spring from mimesis
have also been observed in experiments with children: if a certain number of children are
put into a room with the same number of identical toys, it is unlikely that the distribution
of the toys will proceed without quarrelling. Many of our rules of polite behaviour seem
to be designed to prevent precisely this type of conflicts. Apparently, human societies, as
those of many species of animals, are continually trying to control acquisitive mimesis.

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>In the past, people studying society and culture have tried to explain the origin of religion. They did not find a good explanation, so they said that it was impossible to explain the origin of religion.
      People studying the behaviour of animals have also tried to explain something else: how did we develop the things that distinguish us from other animals?
      There is a problem with many theories of human culture: they are based on something that is typically human.
      This is not a correct method.
    </p>
    <p><span lang="fr">René Girard</span> bases his theory on something that <em>both</em> we and other animals do:
      imitation. Imitation is very important for learning: the better an animal can imitate, the better it can learn.
      For more than 2000 years, philosophers and other thinkers thought that imitation is something that causes harmony.
      But animals and people can also imitate someone who takes something, and this can lead to conflicts.
      <span lang="fr">René Girard</span> says that this kind of imitation must not be ignored in theories about human culture.
      Preventing conflicts that are caused by this kind of imitation is an important aspect of culture.
