    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <p>To make a good cup of tea, you need to take several parameters into account:
      water temperature, water quality, steeping time, quantity of tea and quantity of water.
      If the steeping time is too long or the water is too hot, the tea becomes bitter or unpleasant to drink. 
      If the steeping time is too short or there is too little leaf, the tea becomes tasteless or weak.
      The steeping time should also be adapted to the type of tea (white, green, black, oolong, &hellip;).
      Below are a few basic guidelines.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a smaller pot for high-quality teas. A smaller pot generally results in better tea.</li>
      <li>If you use tap water, you should filter it; &ldquo;hard&rdquo; water can ruin the taste of the tea.</li>
      <li>If you use a greater amount of tea leaves and a higher water temperature, you can shorten the steeping time.</li>
      <li>With a greater amount of leaves and a short steeping time, the tea can be infused several times:
        two or three times for white and green tea, and up to seven times for oolong.</li>
      <li>Smaller tea leaves (or particles) require a shorter steeping time.</li>
      <li>Separate the leaves from the water when the tea after the appropriate steeping time to avoid bitterness 
        through over-steeping.</li>
      <li>Warm the teapot with hot water before making tea.</li>
      <li>Hotter water generally brings out the taste of the roast of the tea, while cooler water brings out the floral qualities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The guidelines below provide quantities and infusion times based on the Chinese
      Gongfu method, which consists in using a large amount of tea and a short
      infusion time. The Western approach is to us smaller quantities and a longer
      steeping time, which also produces a nice cup of tea. You can experiment 
      with these approaches to find out what you prefer. You may like to drink
      different types of tea in different ways.</p>
    <p>Some tea shops can give you recommendations on water temperature and 
      infusion time. See for example the recommendations by the
      <a href="http://www.jcm.co.uk/">Journal of Chinese Medicine</a>.
      Some tea shops also recommend specific methods depending on the type of tea:
      Gongfu, gaiwan, or with glass tea ware. See for example,
      <a href="http://www.jcm.co.uk/catalogue.php?catID=271">Making Tea</a> (The Journal of Chinese Medicine)
      and <a href="http://www.sevencups.com/tea-making.php">Making or Steeping Tea</a> (Seven Cups).
      The United Kingdom Tea Council even has advice on whether milk should be added or not;
      see <a href="http://www.tea.co.uk/index.php?pgId=11">Make a Perfect Brew</a>. Note that
      the Chinese never add anything to their tea.
    </p>
    <h3>White Tea</h3>
    <p>For white tea, use 2.5 to 3 grams of tea for 225 <abbr title="milliliter">ml</abbr> of water.
      The ideal infusion time is 1-2 minutes, 
      at a brewing temperature of 85-90°<abbr title="Celsius">C</abbr>.
      Boiling water takes between 30 and 60 seconds to cool to this temperature.
      The <a href="http://www.jcm.co.uk/catalogue.php?catID=458">Journal of Chinese Medicine</a>
      recommends 60-70°<abbr title="Celsius">C</abbr>, however.
      Some people recommend infusion times between 4 and 15 minutes;
      it is good to experiment to suit your own taste.
    </p>
    <h3>Green Tea</h3>
    <p>For green tea, use 3 grams of tea for 225 <abbr title="milliliter">ml</abbr> of water.
      The ideal infusion time is 30 seconds to 1 minute, 
      at a brewing temperature of 75-85°<abbr title="Celsius">C</abbr>.
      Others recommend 1 to 2 minutes.
    </p>
    <h3>Oolong Tea</h3>
    <p>For oolong tea, use 2.5 to 3 grams of tea for 225 <abbr title="milliliter">ml</abbr> of water.
      The ideal infusion time is 15 seconds to 1 minute, 
      at a brewing temperature of 90-100°<abbr title="Celsius">C</abbr>.
      Some people recommend infusion times of 30-60 seconds to as long as 9 minutes,
      for a more full-bodied taste: green or jade oolong has an infusion time of
      30 seconds or longer; amber oolong 1 to 9 minutes.
    </p>
    <h3>Black Tea</h3>
    <p>For black tea, use 3 grams of tea for 225 <abbr title="milliliter">ml</abbr> of water.
      The ideal infusion time is 15 seconds to 1 minute, 
      at a brewing temperature of 90-100°<abbr title="Celsius">C</abbr>.
      Others recommend infusion times of 3 to 5 minutes.
    </p>
    <h3>Puer Tea</h3>
    <p>For puer tea, use 4 grams of tea for 225 <abbr title="milliliter">ml</abbr> of water.
      The ideal infusion time is 10 seconds to 1 minute, 
      at a brewing temperature of 90-100°<abbr title="Celsius">C</abbr>.
    </p>
    <h3>Scented Tea</h3>
    <p>For scented tea, use 2.5 grams of tea for 225 <abbr title="milliliter">ml</abbr> of water.
      Recommendations for infusion times vary from 10 seconds to several minutes, 
      at a brewing temperature of 90-100°<abbr title="Celsius">C</abbr>.
      It is probably wise to take the ideal temperature of the base tea into account,
      as this varies depending on whether the base is white, green or black tea.
