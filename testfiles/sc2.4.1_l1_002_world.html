      However, our reporter Christopher Neilkot says he discovered that Frodo now lives in the

    <h2><a id="lion" name="lion">Lion Eats Grey Witch</a></h2>
    <p>Yesterday, the grey witch was eaten by her pet lion. Neighbours say they heard
      an argument between the witch and the lion at lunch time. Apparently, the witch
      was chiding the lion for putting too much gravy on his lamb chops and threatened to turn him into a wardrobe.
      The lion, who was tired of the endless arguments about his high cholesterol levels, 
      had his fill of the witch and ate her.
