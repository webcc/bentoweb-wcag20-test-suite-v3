  <h1>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</h1>
  <h2>1</h2>
    
    <p>These guidelines explain how to make Web content
     accessible to people with
    disabilities. The guidelines are intended for all Web content
    developers (page authors and site designers) and for
    developers of authoring tools. The primary goal of
    these guidelines is to promote accessibility. However, following them
    will also make Web content more available to <em>all</em> users, whatever
    user agent 
      they are using (e.g., desktop
    browser, voice browser, mobile phone, automobile-based 
    personal computer, etc.)  or
    constraints they may be operating under (e.g., noisy 
    surroundings, under- or over-illuminated rooms, in a hands-free
    environment, etc.). Following these guidelines will also help people
    find information on the Web more quickly. These guidelines do not
    discourage content developers from using images, video, etc., but
    rather explain how to make multimedia content more accessible to a wide
    audience.</p>
    
    <p>This is a reference document for accessibility principles and
    design ideas. Some of the strategies discussed in this document
    address certain Web internationalization and mobile access
    concerns. However, this document focuses on accessibility and does not
    fully address the related concerns of other 
    <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Activities. Please
    consult the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Mobile">W3C Mobile Access
    Activity home page</a> and the
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/International">W3C Internationalization
    Activity home page</a> for more information.</p>
    
  <h2><a id="Introduction" name="Introduction"></a>2</h2>
  <p>For those unfamiliar with accessibility issues pertaining to
    Web page design, consider that many users may be operating
    in contexts very different from your own:
  </p>

  <ul>
     <li>They may not be able to see, hear, move, or
         may not be able to process some types of 
         information easily or at all.</li>
     <li>They may have difficulty reading or comprehending text.</li>
     <li>They may not have or be able to use a keyboard or mouse.</li>
     <li>They may have a text-only screen, a small screen, or
         a slow Internet connection.</li>
     <li>They may not speak or understand fluently
         the language in which the document is written.</li>
     <li>They may be in a situation where their eyes, ears, or
         hands are busy or interfered with (e.g., driving to work, 
         working in a loud environment, etc.).</li>
     <li>They may have an early version of a browser, a different
         browser entirely, a voice browser, or a 
         different operating system.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Content developers must consider these
  different situations during page design.  While there are several
  situations to consider, each accessible design choice generally
  benefits several disability groups at once and the Web community as a
  whole. For example, by using style
  sheets to control font styles and eliminating the FONT element,
  HTML authors will have more control over their pages, make those
  pages more accessible to people with low vision, and by sharing the
  style sheets, will often shorten page download times for all
  users.</p>
  <p>The guidelines discuss accessibility issues and provide
  accessible design solutions. They address typical scenarios
  (similar to the font style example) that may pose problems for users
  with certain disabilities. For example, the first guideline explains how content
  developers can make images accessible. Some users may not be able to see
  images, others may use text-based browsers that do not support
  images, while others may have turned off support for images (e.g.,
  due to a slow Internet connection). The guidelines do not suggest
  avoiding images as a way to improve accessibility.  Instead,
  they explain that providing a text
  equivalent of the image will make it accessible. </p>

  <h2>3</h2>
  <p>The guidelines address two general themes: ensuring graceful transformation, and making content understandable and navigable.</p>
  
  <h3>3.1</h3>
  <p>By following these guidelines, content developers can create pages
    that transform gracefully.  Pages that transform gracefully remain
    accessible despite any of the constraints described in the <a href="#Introduction">introduction</a>, including physical, sensory,
    and cognitive disabilities, work constraints, and technological
    barriers. Here are some keys to designing pages that transform
    gracefully:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Separate structure from presentation (refer to 
        the difference between content,
        structure, and presentation).</li>
  
    <li>Provide text (including text equivalents). Text
    can be rendered in ways that are available to almost all browsing
    devices and accessible to almost all users.</li>
  
    <li>Create documents that work even if the user 
        cannot see and/or hear. Provide information
        that serves the same purpose or function as
        audio or video in ways 
        suited to alternate sensory channels as well. 
        This does not mean creating a prerecorded
        audio version of an entire site to make it accessible to
        users who are blind. Users who are blind can use
        screen reader technology to
        render all text information in a page.
  </li> 
  
    <li>Create documents that do not rely on one type of hardware.
       Pages should be usable by people
       without mice, with small screens, low resolution screens, 
       black and white screens, no screens, with only voice or text
       output, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The theme of graceful transformation is addressed primarily by
  guidelines 1 to 11.</p>

  
  <h3>3.2</h3>
  <p>Content developers should make content understandable and
    navigable.  This includes not only making the language clear and
    simple, but also providing understandable mechanisms for navigating
    within and between pages. Providing navigation tools and orientation
    information in pages will maximize accessibility and usability.
    Not all users can make use of visual clues such as image
    maps, proportional scroll bars, side-by-side frames, or graphics that
    guide sighted users of graphical desktop browsers. Users also lose
    contextual information when they can only view a portion of a page,
    either because they are accessing the page one word at a time (speech
    synthesis or 
    braille display), or one section at a time (small display,
    or a magnified display). Without orientation information,
    users may not be able to understand very large tables, lists, menus, etc.</p>

  <p>The theme of making content understandable and navigable is
    addressed primarily in guidelines 12 to 14.
