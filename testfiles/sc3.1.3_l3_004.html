<h1>The Battle of the River Plate</h1>
<p>(&hellip;)</p>
<p>At about 06:14 local time (<acronym title="Greenwhich Mean Time">GMT</acronym> -2) on 13 December the ships sighted each other and closed.
<i lang="de">Admiral Graf Spee</i>, despite having correctly identified <i>Exeter</i>, initially suspected that the two light cruisers were smaller
destroyers and that the British ships were protecting a merchant convoy, the destruction of which would be a major prize.</p>
<p>The British executed their battle plan: <i>Exeter</i> turned to the north-west whilst <i>Ajax</i> and <i>Achilles</i>, operating together, turned to the north-east.
The <i lang="de">Graf Spee</i> opened fire with her six 11-inch (280 <abbr title="millimetre">mm</abbr>) guns at 06:18, eventually splitting her turrets
between the two targets to the detriment of accurate gunnery, as the British had planned. <i>Exeter</i> opened fire at 06:20, <i>Achilles</i> at 06:21,
<i>Exeter's</i> aft guns at 06:22 and <i>Ajax</i> at 06:23.</p>
<p>At 06:23 an 11-inch (280 <abbr>mm</abbr>) shell burst just short of <i>Exeter</i>, abreast the middle of the ship. Splinters from this shell killed the torpedo
tubes' crews, damaged the ship's communications, and riddled the funnels and searchlights. One minute later <i>Exeter</i> suffered a direct hit.
This shell struck her B-turret, putting it and its two guns out of action. Shrapnel swept the bridge, killing or wounding all bridge personnel except the captain and two others.
Captain Bell's communications were wrecked. Communications from the aft conning position were also destroyed, 
and the ship had to be steered via a chain of messengers for the rest of the battle.</p>
<p>Meanwhile <i>Ajax</i> and <i>Achilles</i> had closed and started making in front of the <i lang="de">Graf Spee</i>, causing <i lang="de">Graf Spee</i>
to split her main armament at 06:30, and otherwise using her 5.9 inch (150 <abbr>mm</abbr>) guns against them.</p>
<p>At 06:32 <i>Exeter</i> fired two torpedoes from her starboard tubes but both missed. At 06:37 <i>Ajax</i> launched her spotter aircraft
from its catapult. 
At 06:38, the <acronym>HMS</acronym> Exeter turned so that she could fire her port torpedoes and received two more direct hits from 11-inch shells. 
One hit A-turret and put it out of action, the other entered the hull and started fires. 
At this point <i>Exeter</i> was severely damaged, having only Y-turret in action, a seven degree list, was being flooded and being steered with the use of her small boat's compass.</p>
<p>At 06:40 an 11-inch shell burst just short of <i>Achilles</i>, in line with the bridge, damaging her and causing a few casualties.
However, gunnery continued from the secondary control position. At about this time <i lang="de">Admiral Graf Spee</i> turned to the west under the cover of a smokescreen. 
The light cruisers were now doing about 31 knots, having worked up to speed from 14 knots initially.</p>
<p>At 06:56, <acronym>HMS</acronym> <i>Ajax</i> and <acronym>HMS</acronym> <i>Achilles</i> 
turned to starboard to bring all their guns to bear, causing at 07:10 <i lang="de">Admiral Graf Spee</i> to turn away and lay a smokescreen. 
At 07:10 the two light cruisers turned to reduce the range from 8 miles (13 <abbr title="kilometre">km</abbr>), even though this meant only their forward guns could fire.</p>
<p>At 07:16 <i lang="de">Admiral Graf Spee</i> turned to port and headed straight for the heavily damaged <i>Exeter</i>, 
but fire from <i>Ajax</i> and <i>Achilles</i> forced the <i lang="de">Graf Spee</i> at 07:20 to turn and fire her 11-inch guns at them, 
who turned to starboard to bring all their guns to bear.</p>
<p><i>Ajax</i> turned to starboard at 07:24 and fired her torpedoes at a range of 4.5 miles (7 km), causing <i lang="de">Admiral Graf Spee</i> to turn away under a smokescreen.</p>
<p>At 07:25 <i>Ajax</i> was hit by an 11-inch shell that put X-turret out of action and jammed Y-turret, causing some casualties.</p>
