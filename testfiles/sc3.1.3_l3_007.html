<h1>The Battle of the River Plate</h1>
<p>(&hellip;)</p>
<p>At about 06:14 local time (<acronym title="Greenwhich Mean Time">GMT</acronym> -2) on 13 December the ships sighted each other and <a href="sc3.1.3_l3_007_glossary.html#defClose" class="gloss">closed</a>.
<i lang="de"><a href="sc3.1.3_l3_005_dummy.html">Admiral Graf Spee</a></i>, despite having correctly identified <i><a href="sc3.1.3_l3_005_dummy.html">Exeter</a></i>, initially suspected that the two light <a href="sc3.1.3_l3_007_glossary.html#defCruiser" class="gloss">cruisers</a> were smaller
<a href="sc3.1.3_l3_007_glossary.html#defDestroyer" class="gloss">destroyers</a> and that the British ships were protecting a merchant <a href="sc3.1.3_l3_007_glossary.html#defConvoy" class="gloss">convoy</a>, the destruction of which would be a major prize.</p>
<p>The British executed their battle plan: <i>Exeter</i> turned to the north-west whilst <i><a href="sc3.1.3_l3_005_dummy.html">Ajax</a></i> and <i><a href="sc3.1.3_l3_005_dummy.html">Achilles</a></i>, operating together, turned to the north-east.
The <i lang="de">Graf Spee</i> opened fire with her six 11-inch (280 <abbr title="millimetre">mm</abbr>) guns at 06:18, eventually splitting her <a href="sc3.1.3_l3_007_glossary.html#defTurret" class="gloss">turrets</a>
between the two targets to the detriment of accurate gunnery, as the British had planned. <i>Exeter</i> opened fire at 06:20, <i>Achilles</i> at 06:21,
<i>Exeter's</i> <a href="sc3.1.3_l3_007_glossary.html#defAft" class="gloss">aft</a> guns at 06:22 and <i>Ajax</i> at 06:23.</p>
<p>At 06:23 an 11-inch (280 <abbr>mm</abbr>) <a href="sc3.1.3_l3_007_glossary.html#defShell" class="gloss">shell</a> burst just short of <i>Exeter</i>, <a href="sc3.1.3_l3_007_glossary.html#defAbreast" class="gloss">abreast</a> the middle of the ship. Splinters from this shell killed the <a href="sc3.1.3_l3_007_glossary.html#defTorpedo" class="gloss">torpedo</a>
tubes' crews, damaged the ship's communications, and riddled the <a href="sc3.1.3_l3_007_glossary.html#defFunnel" class="gloss">funnels</a> and searchlights. One minute later <i>Exeter</i> suffered a direct hit.
This shell struck her B-turret, putting it and its two guns out of action. <a href="sc3.1.3_l3_007_glossary.html#defShrapnel" class="gloss">Shrapnel</a> swept the <a href="sc3.1.3_l3_007_glossary.html#defBridge" class="gloss">bridge</a>, killing or wounding all bridge personnel except the captain and two others.
<a href="sc3.1.3_l3_005_dummy.html">Captain Bell's</a> communications were wrecked. Communications from the aft <a href="sc3.1.3_l3_007_glossary.html#defConn" class="gloss">conning</a> position were also destroyed, 
and the ship had to be steered via a chain of messengers for the rest of the battle.</p>
<p>Meanwhile <i>Ajax</i> and <i>Achilles</i> had closed and started making in front of the <i lang="de">Graf Spee</i>, causing <i lang="de">Graf Spee</i>
to split her main armament at 06:30, and otherwise using her 5.9 inch (150 <abbr>mm</abbr>) guns against them.</p>
<p>At 06:32 <i>Exeter</i> fired two torpedoes from her <a href="sc3.1.3_l3_007_glossary.html#defStarboard" class="gloss">starboard</a> tubes but both missed. At 06:37 <i>Ajax</i> launched her <a href="sc3.1.3_l3_007_glossary.html#defSpotter" class="gloss">spotter</a> aircraft
from its <a href="sc3.1.3_l3_007_glossary.html#defCatapult" class="gloss">catapult</a>. 
At 06:38, the <acronym>HMS</acronym> Exeter turned so that she could fire her <a href="sc3.1.3_l3_007_glossary.html#defPort" class="gloss">port</a> torpedoes and received two more direct hits from 11-inch shells. 
One hit A-turret and put it out of action, the other entered the <a href="sc3.1.3_l3_007_glossary.html#defHull" class="gloss">hull</a> and started fires. 
At this point <i>Exeter</i> was severely damaged, having only Y-turret in action, a seven degree list, was being flooded and being steered with the use of her small boat's compass.</p>
<p>At 06:40 an 11-inch shell burst just short of <i>Achilles</i>, in line with the bridge, damaging her and causing a few casualties.
However, gunnery continued from the secondary control position. At about this time <i lang="de">Admiral Graf Spee</i> turned to the west under the cover of a smokescreen. 
The light cruisers were now doing about 31 <a href="sc3.1.3_l3_007_glossary.html#defKnot" class="gloss">knots</a>, having worked up to speed from 14 knots initially.</p>
<p>At 06:56, <acronym>HMS</acronym> <i>Ajax</i> and <acronym>HMS</acronym> <i>Achilles</i> 
turned to starboard to bring all their guns to bear, causing at 07:10 <i>Admiral Graf Spee</i> to turn away and lay a smokescreen. 
At 07:10 the two light cruisers turned to reduce the range from 8 miles (13 <abbr title="kilometre">km</abbr>), even though this meant only their forward guns could fire.</p>
<p>At 07:16 <i lang="de">Admiral Graf Spee</i> turned to port and headed straight for the heavily damaged <i>Exeter</i>, 
but fire from <i>Ajax</i> and <i>Achilles</i> forced the <i lang="de">Graf Spee</i> at 07:20 to turn and fire her 11-inch guns at them, 
who turned to starboard to bring all their guns to bear.</p>
<p><i>Ajax</i> turned to starboard at 07:24 and fired her torpedoes at a range of 4.5 miles (7 km), causing <i lang="de">Admiral Graf Spee</i> to turn away under a smokescreen.</p>
<p>At 07:25 <i>Ajax</i> was hit by an 11-inch shell that put X-turret out of action and jammed Y-turret, causing some casualties.</p>
